       <p>  Of course, no interesting hard problem ever shows up in a neatly shrink wrapped package. We've been successful over our careers because:

		We're intensely interested in how hard problems connect to the overall business
		We've learned a huge suite of ways to break hard problems down into smaller pieces
		We're obsessive about communicating what we're doing, risks we've discovered, options we see for moving ahead
		We very much like working with other human beings
		So, if you have some interesting technical challenges, which maybe involve a messy pile of data, or a nasty existing codebase, or a brewing coordinational challenge between a few different teams, we'd love to talk to you.
